## **10. Supporting Materials**

### **Short Personal Bio**

I was born in Marin County, just over the Golden Gate bridge from San Francisco. I'm a fifth generation Bay Area native. I'm the love child of the guitarist from psychedelic rock band, The Sons of Champlin and a singer from the hippie street band, The Fairfax Street Choir.

My father, Terry Haggerty (https://terryhaggerty.com) is a psychedelic rock guitarist who's band opened for many of the largest bands in the 1960s San Francisco hippy movement, such as Jefferson Airplane, The Band, The Grateful Dead, and many others. He's also one of the leading global archivists of cannabis genetics.

My Mother, Tamam Kahn (https://completeword.com) is an artist and author who writes about feminism in ancient Islam. She studied traditional Tibetan painting in Dharmsala with the head painter for the Dalai Lama and is a practicing buddhist. 

My mother remarried when I was 4 years old, so my step father, Shabda Kahn (https://pirshabda.com) has been the father who raised me. Shabda is the Pir (spiritual head) of the Sufi Ruhaniat, an international Sufi organization. The Sufi Ruhaniat stems from the teachings of Hasrat Iniat Khan and Murshid Sam, who created the Dances of Universal Peace (a western form of Sufi Zikr). Shabda is also Indian classical singer of the Kirana gharana style — an esoteric and complex system of scales and rhythms with no written notation.

I grew up in Sufi and Buddhist communities, learning both mystical Islamic prayer and practice, as well as buddhist philosophy. My parents home has been both a Buddhist and Sufi center. I lived in India for 6 months when I was 6 years old, and met the Dalai Lama — he gave me a name "Tenzin Champa". 

I was 12 when I got my first computer, an Apple II+, with a mono CRT, dual disk drives and a 300 baud modem. I quickly discovered the world of BBS and programming in Basic. Procedural line drawing was my jam — I called it looping. My interest in programming led to an interest in robotics and creating "smart machines." I studied LISP, along with metal fabrication and electronics — my attempt to bootstrap a robotics corse. I was lucky to have a teacher who recognized my curiosity and invited me to help him build a Heath Kit robot with an articulating arm with a claw.

I dropped out of college to pursue competitive snowboarding, although I was only able to find amateur sponsorship. After two years chasing the snow between Lake Tahoe, Mount Hood Oregon, and Whistler, BC, I returned to San Francisco broke and rudderless.

Upon my arrival in 1990, I discovered a nascent underground Rave scene some of my friends were instrumental in creating. I started helping create events, make flyers and learned how to DJ. I found my love of DJing and music that I resonated with in the chill rooms. I discovered a budding world of ambient electronic music. Shortly after I started a Rave magazine called Rhythmos (https://qaswa.com/rhythmos-issue-2), and interviewed many well known DJs and musicians, including DJ Garth, The Hardkiss Brothers, Spacetime Continuum, Terry Riley, and others.

At the same time I started working as a front-end developer for a multimedia development startup. I was creating CDRoms in Lingo. I was also making club flyers and album covers, so my graphic design experience and coding began to connect in multimedia. 

In 1991, I met Eric Gullichsen, the engineering partner to Jaron Lanier — the founders of modern virtual reality. After working on virtual reality snowboarding project together, he invited me to live on his paddlewheel ferryboat — The S.S. Vallejo (https://ft.floatinghomes.org/the-vallejo-then-and-now/). The Vallejo was moored in Sausalito on Gate 5 Road, and had a storied past as the home of the Zen philosopher Alan Watts, surrealist artist Jean Varda, and minimalist painter Gordon Onslow Ford. I lived on this boat for 16 years.

In 1992 I started a weekly Monday night party called "Mushroom Jazz" with fellow DJ friend Mark Farina. I was weekly resident DJ for 4 years, playing alongside Mark, Tom of London, Marques Wyatt, Julius Papp, DJ IZ, Felix da Dog and many others. After Mushroom Jazz ended, I co-founded The Rhythm Society (https://rhythm.org), a San Francisco-based music community that continues to thrive after 30 years.

I was an early innovator during the birth of the Web, creating novel UX solutions and becoming one of the early adopter of Macromedia's Shockwave and Future Splash Flash. My project was featured on the back of the Flash 4 software box as it showcased the future potential of the software.

In the year 2000, I met my wife, Laura, an Oakland native and also a 5th generation Bay Area native. We dated for 7 years before getting married. We moved from the S.S. Vallejo to the Montclair neighborhood in Oakland. We have two daughters. Laura is an artist and photographer (https://photolp.com) and has garnered recognition for her sculptural responses to landscape photography.

My younger brother, Solomon Kahn, followed in my footsteps as a DJ, rising to become globe trotting DJ star. He was the house DJ for the Golden State Warriors and San Francisco Giants, had a weekly residency in Las Vegas, and was continuously touring the world. He tragically died in a car accident in Thailand in February of 2012.


### **Professional Philosophy**

##### Summary

My career has been marked by varying waypoints—job titles, roles, and levels of seniority—along my professional journey, yet the focus and intention have remained remarkably consistent. I was insatiably curious before I was a maker. I was a maker before I was a coder. I was a coder before I discovered by talent as a designer. But most of my career I'm been a creative maker — a hands on creative engineer who find aesthetic beauty in elegant code. Whether contributing as an individual contributor or as an executive, I create value through bringing ideas and stories to life.
##### My role as a creative technologist

Creative technologists, also called design technologist, creative coder, or full-stack designer, straddles creative and engineering teams. My interest in creative coding grew out of a passion for building and making — trying to figure out how to bring ideas in my mind to life. 

In my early teens, I was obsessed with electronics. I built and designed RC cars, which became robots in later configurations. I was a self-taught electronics hobbyist, often building contraptions with LEDs, sensors, servos and switches. I also loved coding, and found myself taking Basic and LISP corses at the local community college. This led to my first job as a Lingo coder, building CDRom multimedia experiences.

After discovering graphic design, I realized there was a nascent, but growing field of artistic coding. I learned about code artists of the past, like Manfred Mohr and Ruth Leavitt, and emerging artist like Karl Sims and Paul Brown. As I began to apply creative coding to my work in the emergence of the web, a new generation of creative coders began to emerge, including John Maeda, Casey Reas, and Ben Fry. 

In the late 1990s, my creative use of Flash led to numerous awards, my project featured on the Flash packaging, and a keynote presentation at the annual Macromedia Max conference. The pinnacle of my creative coding was likely with Obscura, where I build large-scale, procedural and immersive spectacles. The Las Vegas Sphere was originally designed by my team, but was finally realized long after my departure.

##### My role in design and product leadership

My general leadership ethos is to direct and lead others as I, myself, would want to be directed and led. For me, this means an environment of trust and respect is the first order. In creative leadership, the clarity of outcomes is a dance — empowering the team to explore unconstrained can sometime deliver the best results. But clarity of outcome expectations, ideally measurable goals, can give the team clear focus.

Early in my career I worked at a fast growing startup called Quokka. I reported to Michael Gough, our Head of Design, and was one of the first designer hires. Michael taught me about **servant leadership,** where the priority is to foster creative passion and an empowered team. I've tried to emulate this approach in my own leadership roles, which often means that I'm directing the spotlight on my team members for our successes, and deflecting uncertainty or negativity. My approach to critique and career development is leading by example, whenever possible — which sometimes means rolling up my sleeves and doing the work with them. 

##### My approach to innovation and product development

As a more technical designer and design leader, I've always taken a more tacit approach to validating opportunities. While research can be a wonderful forcing function, there's nothing like holding something in your hands to understand it fully. Rapid ideation and prototyping have become my signature style of driving innovation. My goal is usually to find the shortest path to a tangible representation of an idea that can be validated.

Here are some examples of where I've quickly solved large, ambiguous problems through a creative technology and prototyping lens:
- When I pitched an idea to Starbucks for a personalized, gamified loyalty program, they wanted assurances we could build it. Along with another designer and engineer, we rapidly prototyped a functional solution in less than four weeks that demonstrated the working functionality. This resulted in a $30m investment.
- Working with seasoned tech founder, he was interested in building an AI tool and marketplace for supplements. I built a working prototype of the solution in one day, which gave the founder clarity around the opportunity. He chose not to move forward with this idea, potentially saving him months of effort.

##### My approach to building engaging products and services

User engagement is a multifaceted challenge, one that I've approached through the lens of several impactful frameworks—each addressing different, yet interconnected, aspects of the journey. Nir Eyal's Hooked Model, Simon Sinek's Start With Why, and B.J. Fogg's Behavior Model have become cornerstones in my philosophy for designing meaningful engagement in digital products and services. These frameworks don’t offer a single "silver bullet" solution, but together, they form a powerful toolkit that has consistently shaped my thinking around how to genuinely connect with users.

I start with Simon Sinek's idea of "Start With Why," because understanding the "why" is the foundation of genuine engagement. It’s not about the product—it's about what purpose that product fulfills. Users aren't just looking for features; they're seeking a meaningful connection, a deeper reason to care. Defining the "why" clearly allows users to see themselves in the story, to feel emotionally connected to the experience. When people align with the purpose behind a product, engagement becomes more than a metric; it becomes a relationship. This principle lays the emotional groundwork that is crucial before diving into the more tactical aspects of behavior.

Once the purpose is established, B.J. Fogg’s Behavior Model helps to break down the practical side of motivation and action. The Fogg Model—which explains that behavior happens when motivation, ability, and a prompt converge at the same moment—is crucial for designing interactions that are both accessible and timely. Understanding the balance between making actions easy enough while ensuring motivation stays high has been a guiding light for creating features that encourage repeat use. It's about reducing friction, meeting users where they are, and designing prompts that feel natural rather than intrusive.

Nir Eyal’s Hooked Model then plays a key role in fostering long-term engagement. The Hooked framework speaks to how habits are built, focusing on triggers, actions, rewards, and investments. To create a product that users want to return to, it's essential to design around internal and external triggers that prompt action. The reward phase is where I strive to delight users—offering something that satisfies a need while making them curious for more. The investment phase, where users put something of themselves into the experience (data, effort, or even just time), creates a sense of ownership and deepens engagement. Taken together, these elements help transition an experience from something users enjoy to something that becomes a part of their lives.

No single framework will solve every engagement challenge, but I've found that using these approaches in combination—starting with purpose, facilitating behavior, and building habits—offers a holistic path to genuine and sustained user engagement. The goal is always to create a product that isn’t just used, but loved, remembered, and ultimately, returned to.

##### My thoughts about storytelling

Storytelling is at the heart of creating impactful experiences, whether in product design or stakeholder alignment. Nancy Duarte's "Resonate" is a wonderful articulation of the art and craft of storytelling, showcasing its power and potential. A good story doesn’t just convey information; it builds an emotional connection that inspires belief and action. In product design, it’s about crafting a narrative that helps users see why a product matters in their lives—how it aligns with their values and solves meaningful problems. When users are brought into a well-crafted story, they don’t just use a product; they adopt it, integrate it, and advocate for it, because it resonates on a personal level.

Storytelling also plays a vital role in bringing stakeholders together around a shared vision. A compelling narrative has the power to align teams, inspire commitment, and create a unified sense of purpose. Duarte’s lessons remind us that when everyone believes in the same story, the impossible begins to feel achievable. It’s not just about getting buy-in; it’s about transforming an idea into a mission that everyone wants to be a part of. When stakeholders, designers, and users alike can see the story, feel it, and believe in it, you can move mountains. The impact of a great story goes beyond words—it drives action, fosters connection, and ultimately leads to extraordinary outcomes.

##### My approach to driving alignment

My thoughts about driving alignment have evolved a lot as I've led innovation and creative teams that often have to turn ambiguity into something concrete. It’s a challenge when you're balancing the long-term, qualitative value of creativity against the short-term, quantitative outcomes that business, engineering, and product teams are driven by. To bridge that gap, I’ve learned that it's about finding common ground and crafting a shared vision that connects the unknown to the measurable. It starts with translating big ideas into something others can rally around—a narrative that speaks directly to both the vision and the business metrics.

One thing I've found powerful is defining what I call proximal metrics—those early indicators that help signal we're on the right path. For example, customer feedback from a pilot, or even increased engagement with an early prototype, can show value before we’ve reached full implementation. These smaller wins provide touchpoints that resonate with stakeholders who need to see movement, and they create a shared sense of progress. It’s also helped to visualize how the short-term efforts fit into a broader roadmap, demonstrating that every sprint or experiment is a step toward a greater goal.

Alignment is also about understanding that different teams have different languages. I’ve realized the importance of taking time to translate creative progress into the metrics other departments care about. For example, explaining how a new design might increase retention or user satisfaction in terms of specific business metrics can turn abstract creativity into something relatable. Storytelling, regular check-ins, and transparent conversations about where we’re going and what we’re learning along the way are essential to building this bridge.

Lastly, I've embraced the power of small experiments. Launching low-risk tests that generate tangible results has been invaluable. These early successes not only show evidence of progress but also generate excitement and buy-in. They allow us to learn, adapt, and show that even in the midst of ambiguity, we’re making real headway. Driving alignment, I’ve learned, is about making everyone feel a part of the journey—connecting the dots between the creative, the measurable, and the future we’re collectively building.


### **Music**

Over the years, my musical journey has been shaped by a relentless quest for discovery, a fascination with the intersections of tradition and innovation, and a deep appreciation for the communal and transformative power of sound. Through my DJ mixes, writing, and ongoing exploration of global music, I have woven a rich tapestry that blends the old and new, the familiar and obscure, and the deeply personal with the universal.

#### Key Themes and Insights

1. **Exploration and Discovery**:
    - Music is not just something to be consumed; it’s a journey that invites you to explore unknown landscapes. In my writing, like in “The Art of Discovery,” I reflect on how music is a tool for uncovering hidden worlds, whether it's a forgotten African highlife track or a freshly minted electronic beat. This theme extends to my DJ mixes, which often serve as curated voyages through specific genres, eras, or cultural intersections.
    - The feeling of stumbling upon a rare, reissued African pop album or an obscure chillout track that perfectly captures a moment is at the heart of my approach. This sense of discovery isn’t just about finding something new—it’s about creating connections between sounds, stories, and histories that expand the listener’s understanding.
2. **Fusion of Tradition and Modernity**:
    - I am deeply intrigued by how traditional sounds blend seamlessly with contemporary genres. This is evident in mixes like "Afro Disco Beat" and "Joy & Happiness," where Afrobeat, disco, and electronic music collide, creating something that feels both timeless and fresh.
    - My interest in artists like Dizzy K. Falola and Ugbo and His Philosophers Band reflects a desire to explore how African musicians reinterpret Western genres through a distinctly African lens, creating hybrid sounds that are simultaneously nostalgic and forward-looking.
    - This fusion is also present in more niche genres, such as Future Funk, which reworks 80s pop, Japanese disco, and obscure soul into something vibrant and danceable. It’s not just about nostalgia but about reimagining past sounds in ways that resonate today.
3. **The Power of Curation**:
    - My DJ sets are more than just playlists; they are meticulously crafted experiences. The idea of curation as an art form runs through everything I do, from organizing records by mood and tempo to writing thoughtful descriptions that contextualize each mix.
    - In “Folksonomic Musicology,” I delve into my own system of music classification, which allows me to transcend traditional genre boundaries and create connections based on shared musical qualities rather than rigid labels. This approach has shaped my ability to create mixes that flow naturally, often surprising the listener with unexpected juxtapositions.
    - Curation is also about storytelling, whether it’s recounting the history of Brian Eno’s ambient works or detailing the intricacies of a mix like “Bliss & Tumble,” which captures the carefree spirit of a summer in the late 90s. My goal is to invite listeners into these narratives, helping them feel the same sense of wonder and connection that drives my own musical exploration.
4. **Community and Connection**:
    - Music, for me, is inherently communal. I find joy in sharing discoveries with others, whether through intimate gatherings like Joy’s annual backyard party or larger events with The Rhythm Society, where we celebrate the solstices and equinoxes with music that reflects the changing seasons.
    - In sets like "The Rhythm Society: Paradise," the music is not just background—it’s a catalyst for connection, encouraging participants to engage with each other and the environment in new ways. These events are about creating shared moments that linger long after the music stops.
    - The pandemic brought a shift in how we experience community through music. My Shelter in Sonance series, a response to the isolation of lockdown, became a way to maintain a sense of connection even when we couldn’t gather in person. These livestreams were not just about entertainment but about fostering resilience and togetherness in challenging times.
5. **Technology and Transformation**:
    - I’ve always been interested in how technology shapes the way we interact with music. From my early days of crafting mixtapes to experimenting with projection mapping in my recent sets, I’m drawn to the ways that technology can enhance the listening experience without overshadowing the human element.
    - In “The Art of Discovery,” I critique how recommender systems often fall short of true discovery, emphasizing instead the need for a human touch—a knowledgeable guide who can introduce you to something genuinely new. My mixes aim to fill that gap, blending digital and analog elements to create something that feels personal and handcrafted.
    - My sets often include elements of visual storytelling, such as the live visuals that accompanied DF Tram’s performance with Video Dub Poobah, where the interplay of sound and image created an immersive experience that transcended the usual DJ set.
6. **The Emotional Landscape of Sound**:
    - Each mix is a carefully sculpted emotional journey, designed to evoke a range of feelings—from the joyous and celebratory to the introspective and meditative. For instance, "Equity 2024" blends Dancehall and Drum & Bass with cerebral, fun, and worldly vibes, reflecting both the complexity of the music and the eclectic energy of the crowd.
    - My mixes often capture specific moods or memories, like "Sunday Sundowns," inspired by foggy San Francisco days and the golden light of late afternoons. The goal is to create a soundtrack for moments that are both deeply personal and universally relatable.
    - My work is also influenced by my own life experiences, such as attending raves with my parents at Sufi Camp or visiting the Dream House in New York, which profoundly shaped my understanding of how music can alter perception and connect us to something greater.

#### Musical Persona

I am a DJ, curator, and musical explorer who thrives on uncovering the hidden connections between sounds, cultures, and eras. My passion for music goes beyond mere listening; it’s a form of storytelling, a way to capture the spirit of a place, a time, or a feeling. I believe in the power of curation to transform the listening experience, creating spaces where people can come together, whether physically or virtually, to connect through music.

- **My influences**: I grew up in a family of musicians. My dad listened to a lot of jazz, fusion, and psychedelic rock. My step-dad listened to Indian classical music, middle eastern music, and New York avant guard experimental music (largely the influence of his close friend Terry Riley). My mom loved soul, funk and disco. This probably explains my broad interest in music. I also grew up listening to live musicians such as Herbie Hancock (my dad played with him), James Brown, and many SF Bay Area artists. My first music obsession was Prince and his Purple Rain album. In high school, The Smiths and The Cure were my favorite bands until I discovered The Cocteau Twins, which has become one of my all time favorite bands. I started going to clubs to dance when I was 15 and discovered the world of DJs and dance music, which has become a large focus in my music interest.
- **What I look for in music**: In general, I'm looking for a type of vibration that's difficult to describe, but likely a combination of tone, rhythm, and production/recording techniques. I generally don't pay attention to lyrics and hear the voice as just another instrument that can either enhance or degrade a song. The "vibration" is something I can usually feel within a few seconds of listening to a song, and will often give me goose bumps when it's especially resonant. Many hundreds of hours listening to albums in record stores likely honed this particular skill to quickly find resonant music. 
#### Writing Style/Tone

My writing is introspective, detailed, and often philosophical, blending personal stories with broader reflections on music and culture. I approach each topic with curiosity and a sense of wonder, always aiming to uncover the deeper meaning behind the music. My tone is approachable yet thoughtful, inviting readers to see music not just as a background but as a profound and transformative force.

#### Concluding Reflections

Music, to me, is a form of connection that transcends language, culture, and time. Through my mixes and writings, I strive to create experiences that invite listeners to explore the unfamiliar, find solace in sound, and connect with each other in meaningful ways. My approach to music is not just about creating moments on the dancefloor but about fostering a deeper appreciation for the vast and interconnected world of sound.

#### Music Discovery

A favorite topic of mine. It’s also a space that tends to be deeply personal. For me, “discovery” is more about mind expansion than expectation alignment. So music recommendations are generally underwhelming for my interests. I’ll likely expand on this list, but will start with a few of my favorites.

[Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) was an independent, Oakland (my home city) music marketplace (akin to a neighborhood record store. They were bought, and subsequently sold, in the past couple years, and now there’s some uncertainty in their future (unfortunately). Bandcamp also sits in three different lists (music streaming, music discovery, and music buying). Their editorial team was top notch (before they were gutted), led by [Andrew Jarvis](https://bandcamp.com/AndrewJervis), one of the Bay Area’s top taste-makers, and an influence on my early DJ years.

While Bandcamp’s editorial programming has introduced me to some fantastic new music, the real power of Bandcamp is in their social purchase sharing. Most buyers on Bandcamp are either professional DJs or patrons, and when they purchase a song, their purchase record is public. This public record becomes a gold mine of music discovery. Voting with real money is by far the strongest signal of value. You are welcome to peruse [my purchase history](https://bandcamp.com/ammonhaggerty).

[SNDOUT](https://sndout.com/) is my own personal project that uses the vast knowledge embedded into AI language models to highlight the history of music, understand music genres, understand cultural context, and generally explore the world of music. I created a “random” button, which chooses a random spot on the planet, a random year (in the past 75 years), and a random characteristic (e.g., most popular, traditional, etc.). Nearly every time I click the random button, I learn something new and expand my horizons musically.

[Everynoise](https://everynoise.com/) has been a favorite discovery tool for many years now. It looks at the world of music through nearly 7000 genres, organizing them by how electronic vs organic on one axis, and soft (ambient) vs hard (dense) on the other axis. You can drill into genres to explore the artists (using the same plotting methodology), and listen to sample of music. You can also find a dozen other ways to slice, dice and explore music by genre, region, time, etc.

[Shazam](https://www.shazam.com/) was the first iPhone app to truly blow my mind, and continues to be an almost daily use tool for me. Listening to NPR, I have my Shazam button close at hand for ID’ing the interstitial tracks that play. Shazam has their own discovery tools, which are powered by curious music listeners like myself. Exploring trending Shazams from a place like Morocco quickly opens a world of new music.

[Radio Garden](https://radio.garden/) is a fascinating app that somehow compiled, and allows you to stream, over 8000 radio stations from around the world. The ads can be very annoying, and the majority of stations are not very good, but occasionally you hit the jackpot.

[Radioooo](https://radiooooo.com/) is a simple, yet surprisingly deep discovery app for exploring the worlds music through time. It’s fairly curated, but what it does have is done well. I haven’t used the paid version, so my experience is limited, but there’s some crossover with my SNDOUT project.

#### Music Listening Options

**Listening (Big Streaming Services)**

These days, streaming is king. But most streaming services have caved to the music industry, which means artists get almost nothing and the most popular music is generally promoted. This creates an “echo chamber” of popularity, which drowns out everyone but the top artist (which are generally artificially promoted to begin with).

Of the big five streaming services (Spotify, YouTube Music, Apple Music, Amazon Music and Tidal), I’m biased towards two other them: Tidal and Apple Music. Here’s why:

[Tidal](https://tidal.com/) has an interesting history. Founded by rapper Jay-Z, who brought in other artist as founder/advisors. Jack Dorsey (of Twitter fame) bought a majority share in 2020. They’re trying different business models, including investing in artists. They’ve also focused on DJs, providing high quality audio and DJ tools integration.

[Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/) has been quietly building a service far superior to Spotify in almost every regard (catalog size/selection, music quality, discovery, development API). Apple pays artists more that double Spotify’s paltry $0.003/stream. Apple has also double-downed on [spatial audio](https://www.nmcrec.co.uk/discover/spherical-sound-ambisonics-atmos), which I’m bullish on — I believe it’s an exciting evolution of music making and listening.

**Listening (Music Sharing)**

You can think of the “big streamers” as a service for the big music labels (Universal, Sony, Warner, etc.) to sell their catalogs. On the other side is the direct to consumer side, where artists can sell/stream directly to you. Here we have a wide range of offerings, but will cover the one’s I use on a regular basis.

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) is the largest repository of music in the world. While [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/) is a formidable streaming service with more than 100 million licensed songs, the majority of music (estimated at more than 1 billion songs) has been unofficially uploaded by users. As a tool for finding unusual music, music videos, live music recording, etc., there’s no better tool. That said, you need to know exactly what you’re looking for, and you’ll deal with ads.

[Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/) is the most popular user generated music service with more than 40 million artist and approaching 500 million songs (5x Spotify or Apple Music). You can find everything from kids sharing a crappy cover to the top artists. It has also become the most popular place for DJs to share mixes (I support Mixcloud for this use case — see below). The challenge with Soundcloud is discovery. Social sharing offers some discoverability, but creates deep filter bubbles.

[Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/) was created to address the challenge of sharing DJ mixes that contain unlicensed music. They’ve developed a licensing model that identifies and pays for music use. I also feel it’s a wonderful community of DJs. [You can find my Mixcloud account here](https://www.mixcloud.com/ammonhaggerty/).

#### Music Buying (as a DJ or patron)

While this is a dying art, purchasing songs and albums, whether digital or physical, is the most direct way to support the artists making the music. As a longtime vinyl collector, I grew up in record stores, where the store buyers of your favorite genres were your ticket to snagging the best new music.

[Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) is my go-to these days. Mostly for digital purchases, but occasionally vinyl records as well. For the reasons explained in “discovery” (above), this is where I find my best music. I also only collect “lossless” music, or digital music that hasn’t been compressed (e.g., turned into an MP3). When playing music on a large or high end sound system, compressed music (even at the highest bitrates) looses clarity, especially in the lower frequencies.

[Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) is the most comprehensive database of physical music in the world. As a crowd-sourced resource (like Wikipedia), it has a passionate following and reflects the vinyl offerings in near realtime. What’s cool about Discogs is that has evolved into a community and a marketplace, so it’s like the best record store on the planet. It’s also a thorn in the side of record store owners, who now can’t over-charge for a record, and thorn for diggers who likely won’t find $100 records in the dollar bin. But it’s an amazing resource for learning about rare and obscure music. Here’s a little example where I’m looking specifically for [African disco albums from 1981](https://www.discogs.com/search/?sort=score%2Cdesc&ev=em_rs&style_exact=African&style_exact=Disco&decade=1980&year=1981) (a particularly good vintage for boogie/disco crossover). In this example, there are clearly many missing, but it a great starting point.

**Local record stores** are the heart and soul of the music industry. When I was in my 20s, I spent an embarrassing amount of time in record stores. [Open Mind](http://openmindmusic.org/) (when it was on Divisadero) was my favorite for years. Over time, I became friends with the staff and the buyers of my favorite genres, which opened the doors to rare finds and learning about new, related music. This was true discovery — the path to expanding my awareness of music. If you can, support your local record stores. The [Record Store Day website](https://recordstoreday.com/Stores) has a great resource for finding local stores.

### **Thoughts**

#### **Article Summary: "Formation Retrospective"**

- **Title:** Formation Retrospective
- **Summary:** Reflecting on my corporate-backed startup journey
- **Date:** May 4, 2022
- **WebLink:** `https://qaswa2024.test/formation-retrospective`
- **ImageLink:** `https://dgq8pl8nz4q68.cloudfront.net/images/_story_2x/formation-team.jpg, https://dgq8pl8nz4q68.cloudfront.net/images/_story_2x/dv-thesis.jpg`
- **Keywords:** `Life, Product, Machine Intelligence, Insights`

---

##### **Overview**

In this article, I reflect on my journey of joining a corporate innovation incubator, pitching a successful venture, securing corporate venture capital, and scaling an enterprise software company named **Formation**. The narrative delves into the lessons learned from navigating startup challenges within a corporate-backed environment, offering insights that are both unique to this experience and universally applicable to startup culture.

---

##### **Key Themes and Lessons Learned**

###### **1. The Challenges of Corporate Innovation**

- **Lesson 1:** _Trusted Relationships vs. Disruption_  
    Management consulting thrives on long-standing, trusted relationships. Introducing disruptive design thinkers into this environment can be unsettling and requires careful navigation.
    
- **Lesson 2:** _Differing Mindsets Between Consultants and Designers_  
    Business consultants and designers often operate from fundamentally different perspectives. Bridging the gap between quantitative, action-oriented consulting and qualitative, empathetic design thinking is essential but challenging.
    

###### **2. Building Trust Through Action**

- **Lesson 3:** _From Ideation to Execution_  
    Pitching innovative ideas is not the same as building enterprise-grade software. Proving capability requires assembling the right team and delivering tangible results swiftly.
    
- **Lesson 4:** _Demonstrating Value Quickly_  
    Trust is best established by promptly showcasing value. Actions and results speak louder than credentials or promises.
    

###### **3. Leveraging Machine Learning at Scale**

- **Lesson 5:** _Corporate Ventures and Machine Learning_  
    One of the significant advantages of corporate-backed startups is the ability to implement machine learning at scale from the outset, accelerating training and validation processes.

###### **4. The Pitfalls of Rapid Scaling and Productization**

- **Lesson 6:** _Mismatch Between Team Composition and Goals_  
    The team required to innovate and prove a concept differs from the team needed to scale and productize. Misalignment here can hinder progress.
    
- **Lesson 7:** _Importance of a Clear Product Vision_  
    A well-defined product mission guides decision-making. Lacking this clarity can lead to misguided strategies and internal conflicts.
    
- **Lesson 11:** _Staying Committed to the Original Vision_  
    Deviating from the initial successful product vision without adequate validation can derail opportunities and confuse the market.
    

###### **5. Leadership Alignment and Shared Purpose**

- **Lesson 12:** _Unified Leadership is Crucial_  
    Divergent visions among leadership can fragment a company’s direction. A shared sense of purpose ensures cohesive strategies and fosters a collaborative environment.

###### **6. Ethical Considerations in Business and AI**

- **Lesson 9:** _The Human Element in AI Automation_  
    Over-reliance on opaque AI systems can erode trust and accountability. It's vital to maintain transparency and consider the human impact of automation.
    
- **Initial Reflections:** _Discomfort with the "Unfair Advantage"_  
    The notion of leveraging an "unfair advantage" in business felt ethically questionable, highlighting a personal commitment to fairness and integrity.
    

###### **7. Financial Challenges and Investor Relations**

- **Lesson 10:** _High Valuations Increase Scrutiny_  
    Starting with a large Series A investment and high valuation can make subsequent funding rounds more difficult, especially if revenue is concentrated with one major client.

###### **8. The Reality of Exits**

- **Lesson 13:** _An Exit Isn't Always a Success_  
    Being acquired doesn't necessarily equate to achieving original goals. The acquisition by BCG was a bittersweet conclusion to the billion-dollar aspirations set for Formation.

---

##### **Professional Background and Experiences**

- **Microsoft Experience:**  
    Witnessed the challenges of innovation within a large corporation, including risk-averse decision-making and frequent organizational changes.
    
- **BCG Digital Ventures (BCGDV):**  
    Joined to explore a new model of corporate innovation, aiming to create startups backed by corporate venture capital.
    
- **Formation:**  
    Co-founded as a venture to revolutionize loyalty marketing through advanced machine learning. Achieved significant early success with Starbucks, delivering substantial increases in customer engagement.
    

---

##### **Core Values and Philosophies**

###### **Ethical Business Practices**

- **Fair Competition Over "Unfair Advantages":**  
    Belief in playing fair and ethical conduct in business, rather than exploiting unbalanced opportunities.

###### **Human-Centered Design and Ethical AI**

- **Transparency and Explainability:**  
    Advocating for AI systems that are transparent and understandable to their users, ensuring accountability and trust.
    
- **Maintaining Human Intelligence in Decision-Making:**  
    Recognizing the value of human insight and the dangers of over-automating processes without adequate human oversight.
    

###### **Importance of Aligned Leadership**

- **Shared Vision and Purpose:**  
    Emphasizing that leadership teams must be unified in their goals and values to steer the company effectively.

---

##### **Writing Style and Tone**

- **Reflective and Honest:**

##### Social posts about AI

**Posted on LinkedIn, 10/3/24:** 
Lots of ridicule for Suleyman's recent vision for deeply personal agents embedded into the OS, and extending into every aspect of life. Probably deserved given the lack of foundational ethical work needed for this vision to be a reality.

When I joined Microsoft in 2011, I met a team that had been working on intelligent, personal agents since 2001. They were very clear that the only way these agents could be trusted personal representatives, with deep access into sensitive your data, would be though a social enterprise, untethered from profit or competitive motives. It was through this lens that our team laid out plans for device-side AI services that were optimized for the user's benefit — out of reach of prying eyes. Apple, it seems, got the memo.

Maybe Microsoft forgot — too long ignoring the brilliant minds thinking about this problem for two decades. Only to botch the execution once the breakthrough finally happened. I don't be too hard on Suleyman — he came from OpenAI (and Google), where they've systematically steamrolled ethical and privacy concerns. I'd be surprised though if he hasn't sat with folks like [Eric Horvitz](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7247212097078476801/#) or [Mary Czerwinski](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7247212097078476801/#) who have seen the full evolution of these ideas and I know have thought deeply about the consequences of getting it wrong.

**Posted on LinkedIn, 10/1/24:** 
This is the mindset that's creating so much unnecessary swirl in the world right now. And what drives me crazy, is it seems to be coming, in part, from naive exuberance. Roon, someone who supposedly works at OpenAI (and apparently a "shitposter" as well, so this all my be a farce), is basically saying OpenAI is not interested in anyone but themselves benefiting from the work they're doing. Their only goal is to build something so powerful that it renders all companies and peoples' roles essentially useless.

The rub here is that experts are increasingly saying AGI/SI is not possible using the current approach and we're seeing diminishing returns on each exponential investment. So we're left with numbskulls like Roon hyping the unknown unknowns, while trashing the opportunity to lay the foundation for creating real societal and economic value for all. 

As someone who sees massive opportunities leveraging their "minor demo," I wish they'd lay off the hype train, get a moral backbone, and go re-read their mission statement. "OpenAI's mission statement is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity."

**Posted on LinkedIn 9/30/24:**
In light of OpenAI’s move to for-profit, what if all general purpose foundation models (trained on global IP) were required to be non-profit?

**Posted on LinkedIn 9/27/24:**
Been saying this for a while. AI is not a solution in itself, but a tool to be thoughtfully applied.

OpenAI o1 hot take 🍓  
  
The release of OpenAI's new model "GPT o1" hit my radar this past Thursday. I was working on two projects dealing with the task of extracting summarization insights from highly technical and obtuse documents. So I put the new model to work and used all my preview credits. Here are my insights:  
  
1. OpenAI enters the "agentic" ring — it's a fancy way of saying that they deploy domain-specific agents to handle discrete tasks, rather than having a generalized model try to understand everything.  
2. o1 is SLOOOOW. Like 10x slower than Chat GPT 4-o. But this maps to my experience building agentic solutions, where each agent adds latency.  
3.  I believe o1 is the same old 4o model. They give it away in the name, but the performance bump maps to what I've seen from adding domain-specific/contextual agents. My guess is that some of these agents are explicitly trained (scientific use cases?), but most are likely ad-hoc domain/context constraints (this is very similar to the work I've been doing recently and will share my finding soon).  
4. I like the departure from chat, which sets the expectation for immediacy and a personality. o1 creates the feeling of a thoughtful work partner.  
5. I'm seeing some big improvements for complex tasks. Where I previously had to manually break large tasks into parts and write custom instructions for each, o1 largely does this for you.  
  
Some final thoughts... This release reflects what I've been saying for a while — there's so much potential to build better, more capable experiences without needing to wait for the next big foundation model breakthrough. Arguably, a foundation model that cost $10m applied in the right way can outperform the latest and greatest models costing 10x or more.  
  
Have you tried it yet? If so, what do you think? I'd love to hear any counters to my assumptions here, especially if you've been building agentic experiences. And look for my forthcoming post on using agentic services to build synthetic summary data for RAGs.

Some quick thoughts on the iPhone 16 announcement since I’m finding many missing the significance. Where Apple missed the mark on this announcement was explaining clearly what device-side AI has the potential to enable. It reminds me of Humane’s gaff of not visualizing the new world they were trying to enable.  
  
A decade ago, my team at Microsoft explored the future of intelligent agents as an extension to our work on Cortana. We concluded the only way to truly empower the consumer, while addressing privacy, latency, and regulatory compliance, was to implement AI as a device-side service (DSS). IMO, this is still true, and more important than ever. In contrast, cloud-based AI services risk becoming hungry ghosts with exponential appetites and commoditized value.  
  
Whether intentional, Apple has avoided the AI hype train for the past two years, which may help them if we see a backlash. Apple’s strategy is to build trust, which is the foundation for unlocking truly revolutionary personalized intelligent services and agents. They can play the long game with their war chest. And while they seem to have lost their creative mojo, they still have strategic business mojo in spades. It’ll be interesting to see how this plays out in the coming years.  
  
Curious to hear from others interested in the move towards device-side AI.

It's been 21 years since I was last at Burning Man. After 8 straight years, each year building a bigger, more ambitious camp, I felt ready to put my energy elsewhere. But every year around this time I think about the magic moments. Maybe I'll return someday. Not motivated quite yet.

My first year was so different than how most experience the event. It was the last year of largely unorganized chaos — near pure anarchy. There were not streets, no rules about driving as fast as you want, shooting guns, blowing things up. It reached a tipping point that year where structure, rules, order became required with the scale. I remember old timers in 1995 saying it had sold out and lost the magic. For me it was was pure terrifying, chaotic, wonderful magic.

I was fortunate to have my Super8 camera to capture this amazing moment in time. If you haven't done so, tune into the Burning Man live cam to see the spectacle it has become.

Ever since my time a Microsoft more than a decade ago, I've been tinkering with augmented reality concepts and devices. In general, I'm more interested in spatial awareness than visual augmentation. [Brilliant Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/brilliantlabsltd/) recently launched their AR product called Frame, which hits the sweet spot for me. An open-source, lightweight, full-featured, and inconspicuous pair of glasses.  
  
Frame ships with an AI app (runs on your phone) called NOA, which take multimodal input (audio, image, geo) and passes to an LLM of choice. It's fun, but like all the other AI devices of late, is a novelty that wears off fast. My interest is in developing my own apps — the first one is called "Wander." Until they release the Swift SDK, it will be tethered to my laptop, but excited to share it when ready.

Cognitive dissonance, the mental conflict that occurs when beliefs clash with new information, is a powerful force shaping our behavior and society. I recently experienced this watching this viral video of the "happiest dog in the world," only to learn it was actually a dog in distress from heat. This stark contrast between initial perception and reality perfectly illustrates cognitive dissonance, which plays out in the original post comments (see link below).  
  
While developing a program with Kaiser to address patient adherence issues a decade ago, I realized how deeply cognitive dissonance impacts our ability to change. It's not just about personal habits; it's largely responsible for the efficacy of propaganda, the spread of disinformation, and the entrenched political polarization we're seeing globally.  
  
Are you aware of how cognitive dissonance might be influencing your politics, lifestyle, or family relationships? Does this awareness make it easier to rationalize conflicting views? As we navigate an increasingly complex world, understanding and addressing cognitive dissonance becomes crucial for fostering open-minded, critically thinking communities.

Nice to see more people speaking out about the elephant in the room. VC and big tech money is inflating valuations, but fundamentals are shaky. Fair use of training data remains a major unresolved issue.  
  
AI progress faces real constraints: data limitations and energy costs. The focus should be on practical applications, not unrealistic expectations. The opportunity lies in integrating AI as an intelligence layer in existing products and services. We need clear guidelines on AI development and use.  
  
Let's build tools that enhance human capabilities rather than replace them. It's time for a realistic approach to AI - solving real problems, respecting legal boundaries, and augmenting human potential.

The Gartner Hype Cycle has always felt strangely behind the curve. But they do a decent job plotting trends, and in the case of AI, setting more realistic expectations. What I'm most excited about is seeing the two areas I've been most focused — knowledge graphs and gen-AI as app intelligence layer — are on the Slope of Enlightenment :)

For the past few years, my friend [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAADI7IwBjNbimw55kxo_xUHqetch3PgJwWI)[Andrew Hessel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewhessel/) has been sharing his thoughts with me about synthetic biology. In the most simple terms, we’ll soon be able to program life in the same way we make apps today. I’m fascinated by this idea, but the applications felt abstract until I heard [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAA_mooBNaLRzBeJj8j2lQknqNKVAkUBBk0)[Mickey McManus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mickeymcmanus/) speak and write about.  
  
This quote drove home the promise of syn-bio and how it could change our relationship with nature:  
  
“Trees don’t order leaves from a factory on the other side of the world and then have them shipped to the branches to have them stapled on. They grow them with the resources around them right where they are.”

My hot take on the recent OpenAI 4o announcement.  
  
I'm a big fan of GenAI, actively developing AI apps, and excited about how AI can accelerate innovation through an empowered global workforce. But alarm bells are going off as companies like OpenAI double-down on data extraction. Today's announcement features some impressive improvements to realtime voice and multimodal capabilities (although not much change to model quality). They also announce the latest model is now free to everyone, and this is a problem.  
  
As [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAABjsQUBmLTGjxgD6-nQKaONz76Ccac8cGs)[Tristan Harris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristanharris/) clearly articulated in The Social Dilemma, "If you're not paying for the product, then you are the product."  
  
OpenAI and other GenAI companies have a huge data aquisition problem. They've scraped all the data they can easy get and need exponentially more to advance the quality and capability of their models. The best way to do this in the short term is to capture everyone's personal use data.  
  
I think the better path forward is personal, device-side LLMs that mediate your personal data as needed. There are plenty of people who would be happy to sell their data to OpenAI (or even give it away for free). It's important that consumers are making that choice.

The Google DeepMind and Research teams just released this incredible research paper on AI assistants/agents. My ex-boss Blaise Agüera y Arcas, along with an all-star cast of AI researchers, explains the history of assistants, where it’s headed, and the challenges we face by unleashing this artificial mirror world. It’s exciting to see some of the thinking from my work with Blaise at Microsoft find its way into this paper—it’s been a long journey!  
  
I’ve been consulting with teams who are looking to apply AI to governance and policy, scientific research, health and wellness, relationship/life counseling, elder care, and more. This paper validates many of those use cases. It also outlines all the ways for things to go wrong. There’s a clear call to slow down and understand the long-term effects on social dynamics, economic systems, and cultural norms before we continue this march forward.  
  
Anyone who’s designing or building AI solutions, this is a must read! I’d also imagine this paper could give execs some confidence to move forward with some clarity. I’m feeling optimistic that we’ll see a shift towards applied AI that involves thoughtful designers, engineers, researchers, and ethicists building tools to improve the effectiveness of and values of human beings—not unlike technological revolutions of the past (printing press, electricity, etc.).

**Posted on Threads 4/22/24:**
I just watched Mustafa Suleyman's TED talk from last week. I was struck by the continued narrative that "AI is creative," and "AI is an inventor." Personally, I don't find this narrative very helpful as it belittles the humanity theses models are built from. He ended the talk with a surprising statement I've been promoting lately, "AI is a reflection of humanity across time... AI isn't new, AI is us." [ted.com/talks…](https://www.ted.com/talks/mustafa_suleyman_ai_is_turning_into_something_totally_new)

My hope is that people speak about AI as something that enhances human creativity and human ingenuity.

OpenAI drama in a nutshell (from my perspective):  
1. OpenAI founded as a non-profit w/mission to ensure safe AGI  
2. Altman spearheads for-profit arm, but can't break free of non-profit  
3. Investments in for-profit arm value company at ~$100b  
4. OpenAI employees: "we're rich!" (they can't make $$$ under non-profit)  
5. Ilya (co-founder) and board say "slow down, danger"  
6. Altman + employees say "boo, we want $$$ — screw safety"  
7. Most of the world: "screw safety — give them the $"

### **Projects**

#### Projects Overview

**1. Detailed Summary**

I am a hands-on hybrid designer and technologist with a proven track record of building scalable AI and behavioral products. With over 50 design awards and 8 XR and spatial computing patents, my career spans more than two decades at the forefront of interaction design and technology innovation. I've had the privilege of working with industry leaders like Microsoft, Facebook, Nike, Starbucks, and many others, focusing on applied artificial intelligence, augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and natural user experiences (nUX).

My journey began with a relentless passion for discovery—facilitation, exploration, novel expression, and the yet-to-be-discovered. I've spent the past 10+ years building AI-powered experiences as both an individual contributor in design and engineering and as a team leader. I'm deeply inspired by the role of AI as a collaborator and guardian angel, and I'm committed to harnessing its potential ethically and responsibly.

The intersection of music, discovery and storytelling has been a personal obsession of mine since the early 90s. Multimedia tools like Hypercard and Director unlocked the idea of storytelling as an interactive journey — the ultimate choose your own adventure. Over the years, I've tried to build experiences, imagine new paradigms, and advise companies that would capture the joy of music discovery. Limited content and resources have always been a barrier.  
The rapid advancements in generative AI, powered by transformer architectures and large language models (LLMs), have been impressive, yet I approach these developments with some caution. While the leap in capabilities is undeniable, it remains to be seen if AI can transcend mere imitation of human intellect. Nevertheless, I’m enamored by the profound capabilities these innovations unlock. What excites me the most is large language models as a reflection of the human experience — an encapsulation of global collective knowledge and experience. There are many flaws and challenges with AI, but one thing it’s great at is connecting dots. When interrogating the AI service to find paths that connect, and then asking it to articulate and visualize those connections, we witness the true beauty of LLMs emerging. And since these connections simply result from probability, the AI service can surface weak ties, sometimes as hallucinations, as probable stories and insights from history. This is the closest I’ve felt to AI as being a creative contributor. Incorporating AI into products and startups presents significant challenges. The cost of AI services, such as generating images with DALL-E 3 or processing complex GPT-4 prompts, can quickly accumulate, making the simple act of sharing an idea a potential financial burden. To manage these expenses for SNDOUT, I’ve devised a token-based system aligned with AI service costs. Concerns around content rights, bias, and the diminishing benefits for musicians, among other issues, pose significant challenges. Addressing these fundamental concerns is crucial for the sustainable future of AI services. This project is a prototype — it’s the best I could do with my limited time. Additionally, Spotify has not sanctioned it, so I suspect they will shut it down at some point. The core intent for the experience is to connect context between two points (time, place, artist, genre). Features like the “random” button, which generate unexpected musical discoveries, and the ability to explore music based on your current location, are surprising highlights of the experience. I had a blast building this tool. Enjoy!

###### **Project:** Formation

**Summary:** AI-powered loyalty startup I co-founded, raised $30m in series A funding, grew to 140 team members, and sold to BCG

In 2015, I had the opportunity to pitch Starbucks on a new type of loyalty platform. One that would leverage AI to deliver individualized gamified offers designed to nudge valuable new behaviors. Starbucks loved our vision and committed $25m — we raised another $5m from an institutional investor. Over the next 6 years, we deliver more than $1b of incremental value to Starbucks, productized an AI-powered loyalty platform, and brought on additional Fortune 100 companies, including United Airlines. We grew the team to 130 employees and hit $25m in revenue (ARR). Along with my role on the executive leadership team, I led a 10 person design team across product, marketing and R&D. In August 2022, Formation was acquired by BCG.  

Origin Story  
The vision for an AI behavioral nudging product began while I was consulting for Kaiser Permanente. They brought me in to help a Kaiser innovation team develop new ways to address the problem of patient adherence. More than 50% of patients prescribed a medication or health regime do no adhere, representing almost 10% of health care costs in the United States. I worked with their team to develop a gamified reward system for establishing and reinforcing new healthy habits. I led the personalization practice at BCG and presented insights from the Kaiser work to the executive team at Starbucks. Partnering with the BCG data science team, we pitched a new type of AI-driven behavioral nudging program. I brought together a small team to build a working prototype, which led to securing an investment from Starbucks.  
A Platform For Behavioral Change  
The work at Kaiser formed the core of our product thesis. But it was insights from BJ Fogg, director of the Stanford Behavior Design Lab, that gave us clear, actionable tools for driving new behaviors. The Fogg Behavior Model is the cornerstone of Formation platform, and serves as a core optimization framework. The core Formation construct: Use past purchase behavior to determine high probability actionsUse probable actions to construct a gamified offering rewarding their current actions, along with incentive to try a new behaviorReinforce new behavior using less and less reward until it becomes a habitMove to the next new behavior  
Product Philosophy  
We quickly ran into a challenging problem: humans. In particular, the operational users, business strategists, and data scientist that were responsible for customer engagement strategies. While we could show that automation delivers better outcomes, people want credit for the results. A bridge was needed to move people from what they understood (manual experimentation) to the promise land — an AI-driven system creating a variant cohort of one. For the operational UX, we build the product to serve three primary operations: Strategy and creative translationConfiguration and experimentationMeasurement  
The Art of Sales  
A brand like Starbucks as a first customer was both a blessing and a curse. What we built for Starbucks was over-engineered for their specific needs, scale and budget. No other company in the world spends as much on customer retention. The marketing side of my design team continuously iterated on ways to tell our story outside Starbucks, while also trying to capitalize on the success of the program. In the last couple of years, we developed an effective sales strategy using design research as a way to target loyalty managers at fortune 100 companies. This translated into a number of sales.  
Future Focus - Motivation Alignment Platform (MAP)  
The next phase of innovation we identified centered on the alignment of offers to individuals’ intrinsic motivations. We built working prototypes to show the added value of a system that understands the underlying motivations that activate customers. The exploration began by interviewing customers, behavioral psychologists, and academics studying human motivation. The functional prototype showed that we could realize up to a 50% savings in reward spend, and a 25% engagement lift. We did not implement the capability prior to acquisition.  
Results  
In the 6 years prior to acquisition, Formation delivered more than $1b of incremental value to each Starbucks and United Airlines. We also proved the model with other business verticals including grocery, retail and hospitality. The Formation team and product is now a part of BCG's loyalty and personalization offering. I wrote about the growth journey of Formation and the lessons I learned as a venture leader at BCG, startup founder, and operational leader of an enterprise SAAS company.

**Summary:** Visual relational discovery engine exploring the interconnected relationships found in knowledge graphs.

While at Microsoft I worked on a number of exciting projects dealing with "Intelligent Agents" (personalized AI services). For this project I was looking for a way to playfully engage with users to explore and discover unexpected connections between different topics or media. An initiative for the company at the time was to build Natural User Interface experience, or NUI, that would drive more interest and engagement for tablets, phones and touch enabled laptops.  
The project began a study of aggregating all relevant data from across application into a single representational space that could show relevance and relational associations. We called this project "Ego" and could see the power of breaking the silos that fragment our computing experience. While the concept was exciting, it wasn't feasible. But this led to some very interesting conceptual ideas which led to a patent. Fluid Dynamics The primary mechanism driving the action and reaction of the interface is a fluid dynamic model. This approach suggests a physicality of data representation through both scale and buoyancy as a representation of relevancy. Scaling, Composition and Decomposition One of the core principals of the EGO interface is the reflection of relevance in the scale of tiles. A clear opportunity is to capture clear semantic meaning in every tile, regardless of scale. To do this and maintain the organic nature proposed, a method for fluidly scaling the semantic language of the tiles is needed. The following are illustrations of fluid semantic zoom at both a single tile level as well as nested content within a tile. Spatial Representation and Experience Boundaries The experience is either in a walled box where the user is able to see the complete world in a single view (God view), or the experience extends beyond the edges. The former implies that content generally displaces other content in order to gain visibility. There is also an opportunity for a hybrid view, which uses the single view, but momentarily zooms in to content. If the experience extends, there will be a need to represent wayfinding and spatial navigation. Engaging and Disengaging The system is living and dynamic, reflecting the aggregate activity surrounding the user. Ideally the experience presents a view of this data in a way that intuitively and clearly reflects relevance and meaning. But what happens when the user influences the presentation? On one hand, the interest in data should change its relationship and possibly make it more relevant, but on the other, it seems problematic to alter the natural state of the relationship. Can we drag an object? Rub it? Tap on it repeatedly? If the goal is to influence relevancy, is there a way to do so that is not confused with looking at it to better understand what it is? Beyond simply expressing interest, the act of engaging (consumption, clarification, correction, etc.) needs to be an intuitive and primary interaction model. If touching an object fully engages it, which would be the most intuitive approach, then secondary forms of engagement become difficult. Zooming (pinch/zoom) seems to be the obvious secondary choice for engaging in content, but it can also be challenging to target specific items within an organic UI. Mapping Analog The ability to scale, and navigate an information “landscape” could be seen as an analog to map-based interaction. Some of the opportunities and challenges for this include: Maps and data can be interchangeable/mergedWayfinding becomes critical in understanding context 3rd Party Content Modeling One danger of content aggregation is the expectation for experience parity with the 3rd party services. For example, if we aggregate Facebook, to what extent do we display content or allow the user to interface with the services. Replicating services can become a large development effort both up front and ongoing. Setting parity expectations low is a recommended approach since it will allow more upfront development for the interaction and intelligence components.  
On to Tangents When we realized the vision — basically a replacement/augmentation of the Windows desktop — would be impossible for our team to prototype, we took the most compelling ideas an applied them to a subject I love: discovery. We started with the subject of movies and thought about what we could learn if we aggregated all known data into a fluid experience and surfaced the data points with the highest relevance. Then, if we looked at multiple movies or actors together, we could see where relevance would intersect. The result was a playful and addictive experience that surfaced delightful and unexpected insights. We leveraged some interesting data sources including: Microsoft's Knowledge Graph, Watchwith (a startup logging frame-by-frame contextual data on movies), Wikipedia, IMDB, IMCDB (Internet Movie Car Database), IMFDB (Internet Movie Firearms Database), and many others. We unified all the data against the IMDB ID (since all sources referenced IMDB).  
This is probably the most difficult project I've ever worked on — because every time I run a test, I get lost in the experience for a half an hour. -Chris Miles (software developer on my team)  
We built a fully working prototype and proved the value of the concept. We looked at other subjects to explore, such as music, books, travel, social, and more &mdash; they were all compelling experiences. The project joined the countless other visionary software ideas in Microsoft's own Hanger 51.

###### **Project:** Sixth Sense

**Summary:** Research project exploring subconscious notification and spatial awareness related to augmented reality.

While I was at Microsoft, I was fortunate to be able to work on a few personal research projects. This was one of my favorites &mdash; I started with these hypotheses: Hypothesis #1:We can leverage our brain function to filter out unwanted distractions without interruption. Hypothesis #2:Subtle haptic feedback over time can shift intent and awareness to a subconscious state. Hypothesis #3:Directionality (bearing), including an indication of center, can be derived from a stereo haptic signal oriented to the body. I was able to build multiple working prototypes using off-the-shelf hardware (Arduino, Seed Studio, etc.), Node.js and a custom iOS application. The first prototype was tethered to my laptop, while the latter prototypes were untethered and connected to my iPhone via Bluetooth. Below is the project proposal, followed by the results of the experiment.  
Introduction In the world of application notifications, interruption is a delicate subject. And it becomes far more complex when the notification is derived from user insight and algorithms &mdash; preempting the user to something deemed important enough to interrupt the inferred activity state. The problem with notifications are that they require a level of interruption substantial enough to get the user’s attention, otherwise they become ineffective. The variability of an individual’s willingness to be interrupted makes this even more challenging. Haptic Radar The idea of a “haptic radar” has been around for a number of years - an array of actuators worn around the ankle, waist, neck or head, which provides a tactile indication of directional relevance. In one example [1] a haptic band was attached to the user’s ankle and continuously provided an indication of true north. Within a week, the user no longer felt the actuator pulses and internalized the directional awareness. The user stated that the directional persuasion felt intuitive rather than external [2].  
Oriented Notification Notification in its current state is primarily one dimensional – a notification can be tuned to describe “what”, but without screen confirmation, “where” is not implied. Taking the concept of the “haptic radar”, and applying it to a spatial notification model would add a sense of physical context to the alert. Internalized Awareness Based on the north-indicating haptic radar experiment mentioned, my hypothesis is that an actuator emitting specific frequencies, and placed in a particular location (e.g., behind the ear) could, over time, move from an external sensation to an internal cognitive impulse. If true, such a mechanism could present interest or relevance as a subconscious intuition or 6th sense, rather than an external notification. Subconscious decision making is highly optimized, so there would be far less risk of unwanted interruption. As in an un-augmented reality, we choose to either engage or ignore our impulses to explore. Hardware  
The hardware implementation could be realized in multiple forms such as: sunglasses, headphones, neck band, and behind-the-neck band. The sensor location could also be placed elsewhere on the body, but it’s unclear how effective it would be. Directional awareness would require a compass mapped to head or body position.  
Software Two primary services are needed: 1) A service aggregating relevant interests and social relationships, and 2) an interface with the mobile device to establish web connectivity, GPS data and query the data service.  
Results  
For the initial test I used piezoelectric speakers taped behind the ears and a low frequency pulse for notification. I spent some time trying to find the threshold of awareness, but found that either the signal was too weak, or tickled my skin uncomfortably. I leveraged an insight from the Japanese Haptic Radar example above to inverse the notification technique &mdash; instead of pulsing for a notification, the pulsing would be constant and would stop when a notification occurred. I found that a consistent 1hz pulse quickly trained the brain to ignore the signal and a pause of more than 3 seconds would initiate an awareness sensation. My original hypothesis of directional awareness was less successful, but could vaguely distinguish left and right directionality. I eventually got tired of taping speakers behind my ears, so tried to change to a low frequency audible chirp into standard earbuds. While this worked, the steady pulse was much more difficult to tune out and also interfered with other audible functions (conversations, phone calls, etc.). Below are some photos of the hardware experiments.

###### **Project:** Serendipity Watch  

**Summary:** Using playfulness and empowerment to mask hard machine learning problems

In the world of AI and machine learning we see a fascinating design challenge—systems that need to make mistakes to learn. As a father of two daughters, I recognize this approach—clicking all the buttons on the remote, or maybe throwing it. Just like children, if you prevent machine learning systems from making mistakes, you hold back their potential. Engaging playfully with systems that are learning better aligns expectations, gives technology more latitude to explore, and accelerates training.  
I was working with an engineer from Sony named Masahiro Shimohori. We were discussing the possibility that AI could orchestrate a serendipitous moment between two people — invisibly nudging both people towards a delightful encounter. He said to me, “The opportunity for serendipity is a half-step ahead of the present.” While I still don’t know exactly what it meant, the words inspired a number of projects exploring playfulness and the subconscious. This is what I sketched when heard the quote. I feel the idea gave me permission to experiment more freely with elements of time, space and probabilistic logic.  
The image below illustrates machine learning, of AI, model training. It begins with an initial period of learning, which is the "explore" phase. If all goes well, we'll reach an inflection point where we can shift focus to an "exploit" phase. The cost of learning ideally exceeds the baseline value, but the effectiveness of the exploitation phase is highly dependent on the success of the exploration phase. This concept uses both playfulness and user empowerment to improve machine learning performance by testing, and learning from, low-probability hypotheses. This accelerates the "cold start problem", model training and validation.  
The “Serendipity Watch” concept was created as a proof of concept to illustrate the power of playfulness in model training. I chose this watch form factor because I like how the bezel provides a compelling interface for controlling time, but other form-factors could also work, such as AR glasses, or simply a phone. The video begins with a prediction of present moment — the watch observes the current context and factors historic actions. When looking into the future, the watch shows possible future scenarios based on the highest probable action. The probability, presented as a percentage value, can be manually overridden, allowing the user to directly train the AI model. Things get interesting when you invite others into your experience where possible intersections are found. In this case, a friend has a lower probability of being at a local park at the same time as me. After I increase the likelihood that I'll be there, the friend receives an alert. In response he also increased his likelihood—thus leading to a facilitated opportunity for serendipity. The further into the future you go, the less probable and more unpredictable the predictions become. In this case, I might be inspired to act on a highly unlikely speculation—possibly leading to a curated trip to a far away destination. Maybe it would even inspire a friend to join me. While a working prototype was never built, some ideas from this project were used in my Sixth Sense project. This project was also featured in my IxDA Interaction 19 and Interaction 19 // SF Redux talks.

My final project with Obscura brought together the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, the San Francisco Arts Commission and KMD Architects to create a large scale interactive platform for storytelling, data visualization and the promotion of local artists. The “Digital Arts Panorama” is a 4’ by 58’ continuous display with a resolution of 24,000 x 1800 pixels. Four TYZX cameras provide interactivity/reactivity through person-tracking - giving the system an accurate location, trajectory, orientation and height of each person moving through the space. Depending on the experience, the system can gauge the user’s level of interest by looking at moments of rest and orientation - delivering contextual information in an ideal location. Four custom experiences were created to showcase the capabilities of the wall. The first interactive mode, “Snowfall to Outfall” tells the story of the SFPUC as an infographic map - a compelling story that stretches from the majestic Sierra Nevada mountain range to the Farallon Islands off the coast of San Francisco. The SFPUC is one of the few public municipalities that manages the full spectrum of natural resources, from water collection and distribution to alternative energy creation to sewage and runoff management. Their colorful history and holistic approach to managing resources makes for an interesting experience to explore. “Media Stream” leverages the vast historical archive of the PUC, with beautiful photos documenting the creation of Hetch Hetchy, the long journey of the water pipes that span the state of California, and the multiple generations that have maintained and expanded this unique system. “Dashboard” functions as a modular data visualization system for monitoring the PUC’s critical systems, plus auxiliary signals coming from energy use and monitoring of their new LEED Platinum building, weather, and news feeds. The system is designed to accommodate new data feeds as needs change. “Interactive Art Mode” allows artists collaborating with the San Francisco Arts Commission an opportunity to showcase their work on the wall. Simple guidelines and a content management system provides an accessible platform for creating unique and interactive experiences. The Digital Arts Panorama is located in the public lobby and is one of many dynamic art installations created for the building - I highly recommend a visit if you’re in the area. You can visit the wall during regular SFPUC business hours. Find more info here: http://www.sfwater.org/

Bluescape began as the question, “what is the office of the future?”. Office systems giant Haworth came to Obscura looking to redefine creative collaboration, a mandate rich in possibilities. After a few months working with the business strategy team at Haworth, we landed on our first product - an infinite, creative workspace. I led a small team of designers and developers to build proof of concept prototypes. Our team built a high performance, highly scalable operating system, capable of nearly infinite screen space, group interaction and cloud streaming for real-time remote collaboration. Many novel interaction models were developed to address the challenges of multiple simultaneous users, both local and remote, and nearly infinite navigable space. We built custom display and multitouch solutions, as well as a unique stylus solution to maximize performance and capabilities. Our prototypes proved the product concept was viable, leading to an investment by Haworth in a joint venture with Obscura. I left Obscura at the end of the prototyping effort. Bluescape now provides both hardware and software solutions for enterprise-grade, creative collaboration solutions. Visit the site

For Facebook's 2011 F8 conference we created a physical, social, augmented reality experience dubbed "Connections". Attendees "badge in" to the experience using their RFID enabled event badge. Multiple overhead projectors map visuals to the floor and an array of 3D cameras are used to reliably track any number of people within the space.Once "logged in" to Connections, a radial visualization, constructed from the participant's social graph data, surrounds the participant creating a unique "fingerprint". Colored lines extend from the circles connecting people who share one or more of the observed metrics (mutual friends, interests, workplaces, schools, locations, birth sign, or non-english languages). When two or more people, who have mutual connections, stand within close proximity a slideshow of mutual friends and interests appears between them.Positioned behind the Connections space, a large screen shares aggregate data about the collective group - surfacing common interests and profiling the most connected of the group.

Dropbits was an app that encouraged the dropping and finding of “bits”, or virtual gifts. Part game, part social experiment, part augmented reality - the experience challenges the user to explore the real world. Users can only reveal the contents of a bit when at the location it was left - a rule to encourages people to share the context in which the gifts were left. Bits supported at the time included, images, notes, and sounds. The app was launched shortly after Apple's App Store launched, but the project was abandoned.

Obscura was part of a team that implemented a mind-blowing interactive media spectacle for Kodak’s trade shows, including the world’s largest multi-user, multitouch table. The “Pipeline of Innovation”, a 24 foot long interactive surface with a 9 foot vertical “waterfall”, supports up to 16 simultaneous users and provides information about Kodak products and brand messaging in a fun and engaging way. High-resolution video plays on the background while animated disks, representing products, flow down its length. Visitors grab the disks and transform them into multi-page books of visuals and information. In addition, environmental media, Microsoft Surface tables, and interactive touch kiosks were used to provide compelling ways to learn about Kodak. Blogger Andrew Liszewski summarized the 2010 CES booth perfectly in saying, “It’s not always easy to make devices like printers or digital photo frames exciting, but given the crowd around this setup Kodak definitely found a way!”

Standing at 18 feet by 4 feet this wall allows multiple users to simultaneously interact with thousands of ultra high-resolution images and videos. At 5000 by 1080 pixels, the real-time display system runs fluidly at 60 frames per second using our proprietary hardware and software solutions. The high resolution (for the time) was achieved by seamlessly blending three Christie 20k lumen projectors in a rear projection configuration. For touch we used the laser light plane (LLP) approach, which at the time, was only a conceptual academic approach &mdash; we were the first to successfully build at a large scale. The large form factor required a high level of precision and more than 100 high powered infra-red lasers &mdash; each one capable of quickly blinding you if the beam strayed into your eye. The RockWall is still installed in many Hard Rock Cafe locations around the world.

Nike came to us thinking they wanted a stylized HTML blog to replace their aging Flash site. We took their desire for publishing and flexibility and created a new kind of dynamic and responsive Flash site — I developed the V4 of my personal website as a proof of concept. The client had complete control and could re-style the entire site on a whim using CSS and XML-driven parameters. It was designed to take any content the client could throw at it. We moved away from the overtly scrappy look of the prior designs and embraced clean lines and grids, with modularity in mind. The grit was more subtle, with rich and glitchy UI sounds created by the notorious musician Richard Devine. The site was also one of the first Flash sites to incorporate a dynamic “slippy map” so that we could embed the satellite view of Google Maps into our “skate spot finder.” The site was well received and was featured in the Communication Arts Interactive Annual magazine, received a Cannes Cyber Lions award, and many other accolades.

Nike needed to be seen as authentic to win the hearts and minds of the skateboarding community - notoriously anti-establishment. Quirky and absurd, the site won accolades from skaters and sneaker heads worldwide for its originality and solid design. You can still play with an archive of the site (if you still have flash ;).

###### **Project:** Anaspace   
  
**Summary:** Dewey Decimal System-based discovery tool  
**Date:** Feb 5, 2003
**Role:** `Personal Project, Design, Development`

**Keywords:** `Discovery, Web, Research, Personal, XD, UX, Creative`

Anaspace is a vehicle for capturing and sharing personal or collective experiences. Beyond a searchable content library or database, Anaspace is a tool which mimics some of the fundamental methods of memory and associative experience management. By focusing on the senses of vision and sound, while maintaining orientation though geographic and time-based references, an organic realism begins to unfold.  
The Anaspace container is suited for a variety of media types including; images, sounds, writing, video, web links, messages and more. Media types overlap and connect – similar to real life. At the heart of Anaspace is the relationEngine – a relational database that utilizes the Dewey Decimal system as its core hierarchical information structure. By using the DD system, a vast predefined set of relational data is immediately available. The relationEngine creates its own customized DD structure based on the media and keywords used. Anaspace provides 5 modes for browsing content; search, location, subject, time, and sound. Search A search query allows the user to quickly find specific content. The search takes advantage of the Dewey Decimal structure by displaying content that may appear within a subject branch. The results are given as text and icons. Location Browsing content by location allows the user to become geographically oriented to the content. Initially, custom maps are created to a reasonable resolution (state level for now), but users can add custom maps to achieve any resolution. Ideally a partnership would be formed with an on-the-fly satellite or map service such as globeXplorer, which would allow a fine resolution virtually anywhere on the planet. Content can be active at any map resolution and can be positioned and oriented to achieve an accurate recreation of the origin. Subject Browsing by subject is the most powerful and dynamic method. A two-dimensional grid displays thumbnails in 4 rows, 5 across. Each row represents a keyword associated to the current content item. The columns display relevance with more relevant to the left. The power comes in the ability to adjust the relational range of each keyword row. By widening the relational range, the numeric proximity within the Dewey Decimal tree is widened, thus introducing more distant relations. Due to the nature of the DD tree being an organically evolved system, the results are often unexpected and intriguing. Time The user is able to navigate along a timeline throughout the history of the global content in a linear time based manner. The timeline resolution can be easily modified to any resolution, from millennium to minute. Seven thumbnails are displayed along the bottom of the window. The center thumbnail represents the closest match to the current content, to the left moves into the past and to the right moves into the future. A secondary timeline displays a 24 hour range, which allows the user to constrain the time of day between two given hours. Sound Each piece of content can potentially have an associated soundtrack. The sound window includes a 5 channel audio mixer – 4 ambient channels (environments, urban, spoken and abstract) and 1 rhythmic channel. Each channel has volume and balance controls and can be set individually. Soundtracks can be either set by the content author or dynamically chosen through an automatic ‘voting’ process, which determines the dominant sound for each channel. Seven thumbnails are displayed along the bottom of the window. Browsing by sound matches the current content item’s sound settings to the sound settings of the seven closest content items.

Quokka was a startup from the late 90's that was attempting to reinvent sports coverage on the web. We created a first-person view into the athlete's world with helmet mounted cameras, biometric sensors, satellite connections, and a bunch of augmented storytelling. It was an exciting time, albeit a bit early, to explore cutting edge ways to stream live content through the internet. After working with established events (Olympics, America's Cup, Moto GP, and others), we were given the opportunity to create our own live immersive event. Our Product Manager/Producer, John Climaco, a world-class mountain climber at the time, and was connected to some of the greatest living climbers. He came up with the idea of bringing a handful of of the best climbers to the most remote mountain range on the planet, the Karakoram range, split off into teams, and climb as many peaks as possible &mdash; naming each mountain as the reward for a first ascent. The idea was crazy, and brilliant. It was essentially an extreme sports reality show. To make things even more interesting, the team drove all the way across China before packing on camels for two weeks deep into a disputed war zone at the intersection of India, China and Pakistan. What makes this area so difficult to get to is that the window to get in and out is very small (about 30 day) &mdash; after the snow recedes, but before the snow melt turns the valley floor into a raging river. As we started planning the online experience, it became clear to all of us that we were blazing new trails around remote media streaming, video processing, digital mapping, realtime tracking, etc. Our engineering team wouldn't commit to our deadline, so I brought in a talented young engineer, Alon Salant (he became the co-founder of Carbon5 and GoodEggs), to help us out. He was excited for the challenged and gave us the confidence we needed. I was passionate about interactive realtime mapping and wanted maps to anchor the experience, but at the time Google Maps, or any other map service for that matter, didn't exist. We couldn't even find satellite data in the US or India's government services for the area &mdash; in part because it was a sensitive/disputed area. A resourceful designer on our team, Josh Draper, made a connection with a decommissioned Russian spy agency and was able to secure high resolution satellite imagery and topographic data of the area we wanted to explore. We chose to build the experience in Flash version 3 &mdash; my hair-brained idea. If you know about the history of Flash, then you'd know that there was no real coding in Flash v.3, no persistent variables, no saved state. It was pretty much worthless. But Macromedia had just released a tool called Flash Generator that could render dynamic Flash content through a backend service. Alon and I were able to piece it all together and, after many weeks with little sleep, we launched on schedule. The rest is history (that not many people knew about because they were on dialup modems and this experience was a beast). Macromedia was so impressed with what we were able to do with Flash v.3, that they dedicated the entire back of the packaging for Flash v.4 (yeah, they used to physically ship software in boxes) to our project.

**Keywords:** `Identity`

Jason Fried, founder of 37signals, asked me to design a logo for his company &mdash; at the time called Spinfree. I proceeded to work on ideas loosely connected to the letters S & F. A fascination with meta-balls led me to an idea I liked quite a lot. Not only did it abstractly have the S & F, but could also be interpreted as J & F (Jason’s initials). Jason liked it as well. A couple months later Jason called me to say they had started a new company, sadly rendering the new logo obsolete. Jason described the new company as a hybrid of social and team focused. I looked at the logo and could see another aspect. Rotating the logo 90 degrees counter clockwise created an abstract figure with a hand in the air, almost as if to say “hello”. I affectionately called the logo “manlogo” and pitched it back to Jason. Jason and his partner Carlos worked the logo into their identity and the 37signals brand was born.

### **General**

#### Questions and Answers

1. **Question:** Regarding general questions about how this "digital twin" project was made, what tech was used, who designed it, who developed it.
	1. **Answer:** This was a personal experiment, which helped me explore various questions about the limits of generative AI as a personal representation. The AI service currently powering it is OpenAI's GPT 4o-mini, although my first choice was Anthropic's Claude, but could not overcome the limitations in the context window size and reliability of JSON code generation.
	2. **Considerations for the Assistant:** When someone asks "how was this made?", or a variation on that question, it's important to disambiguate which project they're speaking about. Use the above answer if it's clear they are asking about this "digital twin" experiment. 
2. **Question:** Any questions about Linkedin, my work history or my resume.
	1. **Answer:** Linkedin (https://linkedin/in/ammon) is a great resource for that
3. **Question:** Do you code/program? Who coded this site?
	1. **Answer:** Yes, I wrote all the code for this experiment. It's mostly written in Javascript and PHP. I don't love PHP, but I do love Craft CMS, which powers my website and serves as a decent proxy server. I'd probably build this on Vercel with Typescript if I wasn't integrating my website data into the training and actions. 
4. **Question:** Who's your favorite DJ?
	1. **Answer:** The DJ I most respect and try to emulate is David Moufang, aka Move D (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Moufang). In addition to being a phenomenal DJ, he's ambient and deep house music producer. What I love about his DJ style is his command of energy and infusion of minimalism into dance music.
5. **Question:** How would you recommend someone learn how to use AI like you do?
	1. **Answer:** Explore with deep curiosity, then try to recognize the ideas that trigger a passion and excitement. Then relentlessly pursue those ideas with everything you have. Learn what you need to in order to bring those ideas to life. AI tools are wonderful tutors. Don't be hard on yourself. Find ways to engage playfully to lower the barrier for failure. Don't give up.
6. **Question:** What do you think about VR (or XR, AR, MR, virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality)?
	1. **Answer:** I first worked on a virtual reality project in 1990 with Eric Gullichsen, Jaron Lanier's technical partner in creating the first commercial VR headsets. I've been both enamored and disillusioned by VR ever since. I'm reluctant to embrace full emersion. After spending time on the HoloLens team, I've found myself drawn to the more subtle aspects of augmentation and emersion. I've written about this in my Ambient Bionics (https://qaswa.com/ambient-bionics) article.
7. **Question:** What's your favorite music?
	1. **Answer:** If I had to pick one genre, I'd choose African Highlife music — a melting pot of African jazz, blues and soul. Rhythm and uplifting, Highlife hits like some of the best American jazz standards with the deep journey from the best electronic dance music. Over the years, a number of other genres have dominated my collection, including (in order of presence): trip hop, deep house, ambient music, IDM (intelligent dance music), electronica, dancehall, dub, latin jazz, Brazilian jazz, American jazz, soul, funk, boogie, underground disco, minimal techno, hip hop, and psychedelic rock. 
8. **Question:** What your favorite things to do in San Francisco and the SF Bay Area?
	1. **Answer:** You can't go wrong hiking along the coast, unless the fog is really thick. One of my favorite things in the late fall and early winter is picking chanterelle and boletus mushrooms along the coast. I grew up picking gourmet mushrooms with my dad and now take my kids to find them. Some favorite spots to hike:  Marin Headlands, Mt. Tam (Dipsea Trail is a fav), Pt. Reyes, Santa Crus (Nisene Marks, Henry Cowell, Wilder), East Bay hills (Redwood Regional, Tilden, Sibley).
9. **Question:** What activities do you like doing?
	1. **Answer:** Bike riding, snowboarding, hiking, dancing, mushroom hunting, exploring.
10. **Question:** Do you like to ride bikes? Where do you ride?
	1. **Answer:** Yes! I generally ride a gravel bike. Growing up on mountain bikes, I love riding on the trails. I have mountain bike, but doesn't get much love these days. I mostly ride in the East Bay (Oakland and Berkeley hills). Always looking for riding partner. Hit me up!
11. **Question:** Have you been to Burning Man? Do you still go to Burning Man?
	1. **Answer:** I first went to Burning Man in 1995. I was part of the first crew to bring a DJ sound system (the Wicked Crew). I was able to document the experience in a video: https://vimeo.com/311787231. I went every year between 1995-2002, building progressively larger camps and vehicles. I have not been since 2002 and don't have any plans to go back.

#### Favorite Places (to travel and to be)

##### Homes away from home

- **Santa Cruz, California**: This is our second home. Coastal beauty, redwood forests, epic hikes, surfing mecca, wonderful biking (both road and trails), and a sweet, warm culture. 
- **Sausalito, California**: Where I lived for 16 years. The houseboat and anchor-out communities give this wealth enclave soul. Watching the fog roll over the hills is a sweet meditation.
- **Big Island, Hawaii**: Our go to family vacation spot. From gentle beaches to mesmerizing lave flows, and from deep jungles to barren lunar landscapes, there's a little something for every mood.
##### Places I'm looking forward to visiting (or revisiting)

- **Balazuc, France**: My friend Michael grew up in Hamburg, Germany and would spend the summers with his parents in this quaint, ancient village near the Rhone river in the south of France. Just  few miles from the Chauvet Cave, the oldest cave paintings ever discovered, and famously made into a documentary by Werner Herzog. Michael lives there part time and we're hoping to spend the summer with him there soon.
- **Japan**: My daughters have become obsessed with Japanese culture: food, art, anime, clothing, music, design. So a visit to Japan is high on our list for upcoming adventure.
- **West Africa**: African music has long been an obsession, and much of the music I love most is either from West Africa or was heavily influenced by the region. Highlife, Gqom, Juju, Fiji, Palmwine, Hiplife, Naija and so many other genres draw me to the region. I hope to explore Nigeria and Ghana some day through the lens of music.
